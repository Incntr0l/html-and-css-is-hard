# Chapter 6 Read Me

This Read Me is for exercise 6 of *HTML & CSS IS HARD*, **CSS Selectors**, and all notes in here will be for that respective area of the training.

Today I have completed all up to Pseudo-Class Selectors in the training page, by the end of Thursday (will be away Tuesday/Wednesday) I should have this chapter complete and uploaded. I change the document around a small bit in the way that the first line does not include "and absolutely BADASS".
