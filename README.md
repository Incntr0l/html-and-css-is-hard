# HTML and CSS Is Hard (Internetting is Hard)

As part of my training, I am to do the HTML & CSS training on the Internetting Is Hard website. I will be doing all the exercises from the beginning of the page as it will help me remember what I had done previously, and help me to learn to use the GIT Bash prompt while focussing on the training.

The link to the Internetting Is Hard website is https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/
