# Chapter ReadMe

This README is to be used as the Read Me for exercise 13 of *HTML & CSS IS Hard*, ***HTML Forms***. All modifications will be put into this README after they have been done.

Edit 1: Changed the text for the basic layout of the form from "Want to speak at our fake conference? Fill out this form" to "Want to speak at our most awesome fake conference? Fill out the form below!".

Edit 2: Changed the text in the "placeholder" field of the "Email" area from "joe@example.com" to "relive@example.com".

Edit 3: For the "Select Elements" area where you pick your shirt size, I added a fifth option called "Not Applicable".
