# Chapter 5 Read Me

This README is used to show what I have done in chapter 5 of ***HTML & CSS IS HARD***, **CSS Box Model**. notes will also be added for this README if I have made changes to what is written in the chapter for this training. 

Finished all of this chapter today, and pushed to the central repo at 12:38pm. Made a small modification to the HTML file, where the training page says "*However (and this is a big however)*, I changed it to "***However (and this is where I say that "this is a big however", but... NO!)***, just to add a little bit of me to the file.
