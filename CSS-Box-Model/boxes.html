    <h1>Heading Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However (and this is where I say that "this is a big however", but... NO!) </em>, 
        &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while incline elements do not.</p>
