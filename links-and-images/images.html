        <h1>Images</h1>

        <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a href='links.html'>links</a> and <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras</a>.</p>

        <p><em><strong>EDITORS NOTE: some text is different from what is shown in the 'links and images' chapter of HTML & CSS IS HARD. I have also changed the 'Character Sets' <br>
        part of the 'More HTML Attributes' section as I know how to spell in Irish Gaelic, otherwise known as Gaeilge, as typing out Turkish is impossible for me to do.</strong></em></p>
