# Chapter 3 read me

This ReadMe is for the Internetting Is Hard exercise ***Links and Images***, as found on the Internetting Is Hard HTML & CSS Tutorial Page. All information on what has been done as part of Internetting Is Hard Links & Images will be put below.

I have finished all exercises in Chapter 3 up until the ***HTML ENTITIES*** section as the final part of the ***MORE HTML ATTRIBUTES*** requires me to type in Irish Gaelic (Gaeilge) (*Chose this as I cannot type in Turkish*) and will be doing so at a later time.
