# Chapter 7 ReadMe

This ReadMe will be used for the next chapter of training as part of the **HTML & CSS Is Hard** training, ***Floats***. I will update this ReadMe with each thing that I have done to when I have done them.

I have finished all the exercises in this chapter and will start on the next one soon.

I have added a few notes to the "floats-pt-2" HTML file as some of the text in the exercise is in Latin. The word ***Dorchadas*** means ***Darkness*** in Gaeilge (Irish Gaelic)
