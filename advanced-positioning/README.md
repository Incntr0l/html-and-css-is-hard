# Chapter 9 Read Me

This ReadMe is for Chapter 9 of the **HTML & CSS Is Hard** training, ***Advanced Positioning***. I will work on each part as it happens.

Did the first half of this chapter yesterdat (9/10/2017), the second half was finished at approximately 1:10pm today (10/10/2017). Added a different option in the drop-down menu. Where the chapter said to put in "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" as the choices in the dropdown, I put in "Harder, Better, Faster, Bored!" instead.
