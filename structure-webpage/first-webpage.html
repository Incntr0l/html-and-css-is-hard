        <h1> Interneting Is Hard! (as if!)</h1>
        <p> First, we need to learn some basic HTML... (and change around text what is supposed to be awesome to
             what the chapter shows, which is mean)</p>

        <h2> Headings </h2>
        <p> I'm sure we all know that 'headings define the outline of your site', as it says in the chapter. </p>

        <h3>Lists</h3>

        <p> This is how you make an unordered list </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it means unordered list)</li>
            <li> Add a "li" element to each list number</li>
            <li> Tada, now you arae doing lists </li>
            <li> They do not need to be in any order, so I can put this at the top if I wanted to. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Ordered Lists </h4>

        <p> This is what an ordered list looks like </p>

        <ol>
            <li> THe same "li" naming goes here</li>
            <li> by doing this with a "ol" naming, the list becomes ordered</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Emphasis Elements</h5>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to aparticular word or phrase... you do this by using the "em" element.</p>
        <p> Other times, you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase. You do this by using the "strong" element.</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em> You do this by using both the "em" and "strong" elements.</p>

        <h6>Empty Elements</h6>

        <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now. </p>

            <hr/>
            <p> P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS soon. <br/>
                The horizonal ruler and line break here and at the "Regards" part is done by using the "br" element for the line down, and the "hr" element</p>
