# Chapter Two Read Me

This ReadMe is in this folder as the ReadMe in the front page (for lack of a better word) is going to be used for describing information that will be needed, where this one is for describing what has been done as part of the chapter. The "Chapter" is the second exercise on the Internetting Is Hard website, ***Basic Web Pages***. Everything that is written is copied from the same exercise that is stated, but added a few extra notes to tell you how it is done.

Completed all up until the **HEADINGS** area today, all changes are shown. (31/08/2017)

Completed Unordered/Ordered Lists this afternoon. (01/09/2017)

Finished chapter two of *HTML & CSS Is Hard* today, moving from part 8 (Emphasis Elements) to the Summary. The Emphasis and Strong elements parts I added a bit of text to describe how you do them. In the **Empty HTML Elements** part, I changed what was shown in the part, ***"Regards, The Author"*** to ***"Regards, Incntr0l"*** as it is part of the training that I had done. If this is considered copywrite, I shall change it back to ***"Regards, The Author"***. (4/09/2017).
